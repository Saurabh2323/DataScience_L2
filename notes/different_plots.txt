What is Seaborn ?

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

Seaborn helps resolve the two major problems faced by Matplotlib; the problems are as below

Default Matplotlib parameters
Working with data frames


As Seaborn compliments and extends Matplotlib, the learning curve is quite gradual. If you know Matplotlib, you are already half-way through Seaborn.

What is distplot ?

Seaborn distplot lets you show a histogram with a line on it. This can be shown in all kinds of variations. We use seaborn in combination with matplotlib, the Python plotting module.

A distplot plots a univariate distribution of observations. The distplot() function combines the matplotlib hist function with the seaborn kdeplot() and rugplot() functions.


This method is used to plot data and a linear regression model fit. There are a number of mutually exclusive options for estimating the regression model.
