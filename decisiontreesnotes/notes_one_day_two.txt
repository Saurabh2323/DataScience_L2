find a program that outputs the actual decision tree
that is built for the dataset. The program should be in python

do the same program for the Rafal Nadal tennis playing dataset

ID3 -  this uses information gain and entropy as the 
       splitting criteria

C4.5 - this uses gain ratio as the splitting criteria

CART - this uses gini index as the splitting criteria
       gini - continuous or categorical
